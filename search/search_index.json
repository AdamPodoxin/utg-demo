In particular, what numbers should go in the brackets and how do we know?</p> <p>We should first create the sprite sheet and slice it into smaller sprites. To slice it, we have to know how many rows and columns this sprite has.</p> <p>As you can see, our slime animation has 8 images. They are divided into 1 row and 8 columns.
